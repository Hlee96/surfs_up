# surfs_up
## Overview
The analysis was conducted to see statistics of temperatures for the month of June and December, to determine if the surf shop can be sustained throughout the year. There were two seperate queries that have been ran, one for June and one for December. Each query returned a summary of statistics table that was a list at first and then converted to a dataframe to run the describe function.
## Results
June had the following results
  - Total count: 1700
  - Mean: 74.9
  - Min: 64
  - Max: 85

December had the following results
  - Total count: 1517
  - Mean: 71
  - Min: 56
  - Max: 83

The main differences was in the standard deviation of a .5 differnce between the two.
## Summary
The analysis show that there isn't a significant difference considering that the months are six months apart. The difference in the mean is only 3.9, and teh standard deviation is also only .5. The data that we have is not significant enough to determine whether the surf shop will be sustainable throughout the year. There are other factors that could change the analysis, such as rain, count of storms, and natural disasters per month. If we can gain more data surroundings other factors, that are significant it will be helpful to give a clear advice.
